 **Writing Business Apps in F#**

The BDDSample folder contains a solution with files showing a number of F# Functional programming concepts:

- Types (Records & Tuples {AND} - Discriminated Union {OR})
- Functions (Signatures)
- Function Composition
- Currying & Partial Application
- Option vs NULL
- Result vs Exceptions
- Type Providers (Csv & Json)
- MailboxProcessor

The code should work in FSI (F# Interactive) in VS2019, JetBrains Rider and VSCode with the Ionide extension).

I will be updating the code over the next few weeks and adding more/clearer examples.
